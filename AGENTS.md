# Project rules
- Domain, workflow, payment, compliance and integration rules live in `src/lib/AGENTS.md`; read it before changing `src/lib`. Why: keeps this file small.
- Server functions are literal `createServerFn(...).middleware(...).inputValidator(...).handler(...)` chains; never import `@tanstack/react-start/server` in `*.functions.ts`. Why: factories/that import break the client bundle.
- Pure rules in `*.core.ts` (tested via `bun test ./tests/`), persistence in `*.server.ts`, RPC in `*.functions.ts`. Why: testable, central guards.
